# <center>How to install</center>
1. You need a script extension such as Greasmonkey or Tampermonkey.
2. Then go down to [Scripts released](https://github.com/No-Death/GGn-Scripts#scripts-released) and click on the one you want.
3. When you get redirected to GreasyFork just click on install script and everything should be good to go. 

*The script will automatically update when I release a newer version (there may be a bit of a delay).*
